"I can't believe I'm going to spend the next year here on exchange, it feels like everything here moves a mile a minute"
"Which reminds me, I'm supposed to be meeting up with my foreign exchange host around here some time soon"
"She said to meet her on this street at around 11:30 am, and it's 11:25 am now"
"It's a pretty easy to reach tourist spot and there aren't many people around at the moment fortunately"
"still I hope she's able to find me, I don't want to end up getting stranded"
"Especially since I don't know any German!!!"
